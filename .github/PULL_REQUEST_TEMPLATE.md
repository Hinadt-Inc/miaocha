* [ ] PR and commit messages are well formatted and descriptive
* [ ] The PR description is detailed enough to explain the What, How, and Why
* [ ] Add necessary unit/integration tests to validate the change. For new features or major changes, include integration tests in the `test` module when applicable
* [ ] Ensure the project builds successfully and tests pass
